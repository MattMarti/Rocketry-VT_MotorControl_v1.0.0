These are the instructions on how to compile a command line executable file to
run unit tests for the Motor Controller on a desktop or laptop computer.
This method is necessary because github will only let us upload up to 100 files
and Visual Studio likes to make a ton of files whenever it compiles a solution.

1. Open Visual Studio and make a new Project
   -> File -> New Project
   -> Win32 Console Application (Visual C++)
   -> Name -> something sensible (Example: Project_Name)
   -> Location -> NOT IN THE .git DIRECTORY (or children)
                  Make this somewhere else on your computer
   -> OK
   -> Finish
2. Include directories
   -> Project -> Properties
   -> C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories -> <Edit>
   -> Add the following (absolute) paths to the include directories:
      - C:/<YourPath>/Device-Sketch
      - C:/<YourPath>/Device-Sketch/Desktop-tests-src
   -> OK
   -> OK
3. Add files
   -> Delete the following files from the solution
      - <Project_Name>.cpp
      - targetver.h (Optional)
   -> Open stdafx.h and delete all the code
   -> In Header Files, Add Existing files from Device-Sketch:
      - Assert.h
	  - Default_Config.h
	  - stdafx.h
	  - Test_all.h
	  - Test_FloatToBinary.h
	  - Test_Transmission.h
	  - Transmission.h
   -> In Header Files, Add Existing files from Device-Sketch/Desktop-tests-src:
      - Arduino.h
	  - stdafx.h
   -> In Source Files, Add Existing files from Device-Sketch:
      - Assert.cpp
	  - Default_Config.cpp
	  - Test_all.cpp
	  - Test_FloatToBinary.cpp
	  - Test_Transmission.cpp
	  - Transmission.cpp
   -> In Source Files, Add Existing files from Device-Sketch/Desktop-tests-src:
      - Arduino.cpp
	  - Unit-Tests-PC.cpp
4. Compile and test
   -> To compile: [ctrl] + [shift] + B 
   -> Go to the debug folder in your solution
   -> Run the executable from Power Shell or command line
