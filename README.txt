TO BUILD THIS PROJECT

$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make

This branch is intended to be built on Raspberry Pi or some other linux device. The file structure is radically different and some files are removed outright. This is all for the greater good. Mainly because I hate Visual Studio with a burning passion.
