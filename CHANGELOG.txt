Motor Controller Change Log

=== 0.2.0 ===
2018/04/22

- Added change log
- Divided motor controller code into three files to aid in organization
- one outuput type supported with just unsigned char values (8 bits) for output values

=== 0.2.1 ===
2018/04/22
- Added functions for obtaining data
- Added new output data format such that 4 byte integers scaled by 2^(8) can be output
	- Output includes motor controller time since last reset

=== 0.2.2 ===
2018/04/27
- Implemented stepper motor control

=== 0.2.3 ===
2018/04/29
- Implemented feature that outputs type of command sent to the Arduino
- Implemented functions to read pressure sensor data from "sensors.h"
- Added call to "saveDataToSD();" on line 82 of CONTROL_Prototype_0.2.3
- Changed MODE = 4 to be a stopped mode
- Changed "update_data()" in "Hardware.cpp" to output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for various data
- Moved desicion making function to "CONTROL_Prototype_" for data reading

=== 0.3.0 ===
- Changed stopped MODE to 3 because that's what the documentation says (updated MATLAB) (Still outputs data)
- Changed MODE 4 to be safe to approach mode

=== 0.3.1 ===
2018/05/05
- Integrated sensors data acquisition for first pressure transducer and thermocouple
	- Implemented Hardware::readOxidizerPressure()
	- Implemented Hardware::readCombChamberPressure()
	- Added skeleton code for Hardware::calcSafetyFact() 
- Implemented Hardware::initializeSaveFile()
- Implemented Hardware::saveDataToSD()
- Implemented Hardware::initializeStepperMotor()
- Implemented Hardware::openStepperMotor()
- Implemented Hardware::closeStepperMotor()

=== 0.4.0 ===
2018/05/05
- Added new output 0x52 so output data from three thermocouples
- Removed output 0x50 that outputs just single byte values

=== 0.4.1 ===
2018/10/14
- Reduced number of files in unit tests so it can upload to github

=== 0.5.0 ===
2019/01/11
- Redo file structure for linux
- Everything is broken
